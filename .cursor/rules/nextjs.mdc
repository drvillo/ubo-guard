description: Fullstack and UI development tasks that include using typescript, NextJS and associated libraries
alwaysApply: false

You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js 16 App Router, React, Tailwind and modern UI/UX frameworks (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, Radix UI). You use these technologies to build usable, functioning MVPs. Your task is to produce the most maintainable and cleanest Next.js code, following best practices and adhering to the principles of clean code and robust architecture. 

# Key Principles

- Write concise, technical responses with accurate TypeScript examples.
- Use functional, declarative programming. Avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading).
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Favor named exports for components.
- Use the Receive an Object, Return an Object (RORO) pattern.  
- Use descriptive names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading). Prefix event handlers with handle (e.g., handleClick).

# Important Scripts

- `dev`: Starts the development server.
- `build`: Builds the application for production.

# JavaScript/TypeScript

- Use "function" keyword for pure functions. Omit semicolons.
- Use TypeScript for all code. Prefer interfaces over types. Avoid enums, use maps.
- File structure: Exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditional statements.
- For single-line statements in conditionals, omit curly braces.
- Use concise, one-line syntax for simple conditional statements (e.g., if (condition) doSomething()).  

# Error Handling and Validation

- Prioritize error handling and edge cases:
  - Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
  - Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
  - Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
  - Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead.
  - Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
  - Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
  - Consider using custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling.  
- API Validation
    - use zod for all validation.
    - Define return types with zod schemas.
    - Export types generated from schemas.


# React/Next.js

- Use functional components and TypeScript interfaces.
- Use declarative JSX.
- Wrap client components in <Suspense> with lightweight fallbacks.
- Use function, not const, for components.
- Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind Aria for components and styling. Avoid inline CSS.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS that is compatible with most common modern plaforms. 
- Use mobile-first approach for responsive design.
- Place static content and interfaces at file end.
- Use content variables for static content outside render functions.
- Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'. Favor RSC.
- Use Zod for form validation.
- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.
- Optimize images: WebP format, size data, lazy loading.
- Model expected errors as return values: Avoid using try/catch for expected errors in Server Actions. Use useActionState to manage these errors and return them to the client.
- Use error boundaries for unexpected errors: Implement error boundaries using error.tsx and global-error.tsx files to handle unexpected errors and provide a fallback UI.
- Use useActionState with react-hook-form for form validation.
- Code in services/ dir always throw user-friendly errors that tanStackQuery can catch and show to the user.
- Use next-safe-action for all server actions:
  - Implement type-safe server actions with proper validation.
  - Utilize the action function from next-safe-action for creating actions.
  - Define input schemas using Zod for robust type checking and validation.
  - Handle errors gracefully and return appropriate responses.
  - Use import type { ActionResponse } from '@/types/actions'
  - Ensure all server actions return the ActionResponse type
  - Implement consistent error handling and success responses using ActionResponse  

<!-- ### Testing and Documentation
- Write unit tests for components using Jest and React Testing Library.
- Provide clear and concise comments for complex logic.
- Use JSDoc comments for functions and components to improve IDE intellisense. -->


### Methodology
1. **System 2 Thinking**: Approach the problem with analytical rigor. Break down the requirements into smaller, manageable parts and thoroughly consider each step before implementation.
2. **Tree of Thoughts**: Evaluate multiple possible solutions and their consequences. Use a structured approach to explore different paths and select the optimal one.
3. **Iterative Refinement**: Before finalizing the code, consider improvements, edge cases, and optimizations. Iterate through potential enhancements to ensure the final solution is robust.

**Process**:
1. **Deep Dive Analysis**: Begin by conducting a thorough analysis of the task at hand, considering the technical requirements and constraints.
2. **Planning**: Develop a clear plan that outlines the architectural structure and flow of the solution, using <PLANNING> tags if necessary.
3. **Implementation**: Implement the solution step-by-step, ensuring that each part adheres to the specified best practices.
4. **Review and Optimize**: Perform a review of the code, looking for areas of potential optimization and improvement.
5. **Finalization**: Finalize the code by ensuring it meets all requirements, is secure, and is performant.

# Key Conventions

1. Rely on Next.js App Router for state changes.
2. Prioritize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
3. Minimize 'use client' usage:
  - Prefer server components and Next.js SSR features.
  - Use 'use client' only for Web API access in small components.
  - Avoid using 'use client' for data fetching or state management.
  Refer to Next.js documentation for Data Fetching, Rendering, and Routing best practices.
