Act as a senior developer working on an MVP incrementally. 

# Task

I want you to plan the implementation of the functionality described in the following spec file

<!-- INSERT PLANNED SPEC HERE    -->

## Methodology

As a first step, assess if there are any logical incompatibilities between the step specification and existing code. To do this, assess user journeys, database schema, libraries and app architecture. Report back what design decisions are needed. 

Keep in mind the overarching concept in @prompts/PRD-1.md and @prompts/TECH-2.md.

## Testing

Finally plan for testing so that new functionality is tested while existing tests are refactored so that the overall test harness does not increase in complexity in an unmanaged way.
